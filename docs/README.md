- **[API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md)** - REST API endpoints, Python SDK, and WebSocket events

### Project Information
- **[Changelog & Releases](CHANGELOG_AND_RELEASES.md)** - Version history and release management

## üóÇÔ∏è Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized for different audiences:

**New Users**: Start with [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)
**System Administrators**: Focus on [Hardware Management](HARDWARE_MANAGEMENT.md) and [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
**Developers**: Begin with [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) and [API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md)
**DevOps Engineers**: Review [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) and [Workflow Guide](WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

## üèõÔ∏è Historical Documentation

Legacy and historical documentation has been moved to the `archive/` directory to maintain project history while keeping current documentation focused and relevant.

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance

This documentation is actively maintained and updated with each release. The consolidation effort in January 2025 reduced documentation from 39 files to 8 core files for better organization and maintainability.

For documentation issues or suggestions, please open an issue in the project repository.
