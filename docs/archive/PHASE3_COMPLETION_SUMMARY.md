## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced SystemInfo Class
```python
@dataclass
class SystemInfo:
    # Original fields...
    manufacturer: Optional[str] = None
    product_name: Optional[str] = None
    cpu_model: Optional[str] = None
    cpu_cores: Optional[int] = None
    memory_total: Optional[str] = None

    # New classification fields
    device_type: Optional[str] = None
    classification_confidence: Optional[str] = None
    matching_criteria: Optional[List[str]] = None
```

### Enhanced Discovery Manager Methods
```python
# New capabilities in HardwareDiscoveryManager
classify_device_type(system_info)        # Intelligent device classification
get_supported_vendors()                  # Vendor statistics and capabilities
get_motherboard_mapping()                # Motherboard-to-device mapping
search_device_types(search_term)         # Search across device specifications
get_configuration_status()               # Configuration system status
```

### Classification Algorithm
1. **Vendor Matching (40% weight)**: Exact manufacturer match
2. **Motherboard Matching (30% weight)**: Product name contains motherboard model
3. **CPU Matching (20% weight)**: CPU model contains expected CPU components
4. **Core Matching (10% weight)**: Exact CPU core count match

### Confidence Levels
- **High (≥80%)**: Multiple criteria match, high confidence in classification
- **Medium (≥50%)**: Good match with some criteria, reliable classification
- **Low (≥30%)**: Minimal match, low confidence classification
- **Very Low (<30%)**: Poor match, classification uncertain
